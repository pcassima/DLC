# DLC

A completely functional computer, with all peripherals built from nothing but 74-series logic chips. Hence the name: **D**iscrete **L**ogic **C**omputer.

## About the project

This is a project that offers a lot of insight into how modern computers work and execute commands. Even though this is a fairly simple computer it works in the same way as modern computers.

I started this project in order to learn how computers work and as a personal challenge to see if I could do it. This is the reason why I decided to make the whole project open-source and free to use ([license](#license)). So that anyone can learn from what I have done or can learn along with me.

## Documentation

Along the way, the project will be well document. By doing this I hope it will be easy to replicate and provide an extensive pool of information for anyone who wants to start a similar project.

### Formats

The documentation is available in different formats, this way you can choose whichever one suits you best.

#### PDF

PDF's are the original format for the documentation, and are available for download. This format can be printed and viewed on any platform, both online and offline (once downloaded).

#### HTML

For easy referencing (and sharing) the documentation is also available as a webpage. This has the advantage that the information is more broken up. There is a clearer boundary between the different chapters etc.

#### Books

I hope to one day publish (part of) the documentation as an actual physical book that can be bought. But for now this is not yet an option.

#### YouTube

The whole project will be documented as a YouTube series. This series will be made during the creation of the computer. If you want to be on the bleeding edge of the project's progress, this is the format to follow.

### Versions

#### Build guide

This is the guide to follow when building the computer from scratch. It comes with a *Bill-of-Materials* and step-by-step guides to building and assembling the different parts of the computer.

#### General documentation ('syllabus')

#### Programmer's reference

### Schematics

All schematics are available as large format PDF's for printing on A3. All schematics have a unique label (or identification), this way they can be referenced in the documentation.

It is not possible to place the high resolution schematics on the documentation. By labelling and referencing the schematics, the full schematics can be viewed along with the documentation.

## Getting started

### Kits

Once the whole computer has been completed, I will try and make hardware kits available. These kits will contain everything that is needed to make the whole computer (or parts of it).

I will make kits in varying levels of "completeness"; they will vary from having absolutely everything to increasing levels of parts you have source yourself.
