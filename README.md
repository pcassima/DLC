## About the project

This is a project that offers a lot of insight into how modern computers work and execute commands. Even though this is a fairly simple computer it works in the same way as modern computers.

I started this project in order to learn how computers work and as a personal challenge to see if I could do it. This is the reason why I decided to make the whole project open-source and free to use ([license](#license)). So that anyone can learn from what I have done or can learn along with me.

## Documentation

Along the way, the project will be well document. By doing this I hope it will be easy to replicate and provide an extensive pool of information for anyone who wants to start a similar project.

### Formats

The documentation is available in different formats, this way you can choose whichever one suits you best.

#### PDF

5PDF's are the original format for the documentation, and are available for download. This format can be printed and viewed on any platform, both online and offline (once downloaded).

#### HTML

For easy referencing (and sharing) the documentation is also available as a webpage. This has the advantage that the information is more broken up. There is a clearer boundary between the different chapters etc.

#### Books

I hope to one day publish (part of) the documentation as an actual physical book that can be bought. But for now this is not yet an option.
